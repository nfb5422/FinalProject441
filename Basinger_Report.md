For this final project I decided, after a lot of experimentation, I decided that a DnD would not be the best subject for my interests and knowledge of the course materials. I used a repository on my home computer for a while and eventually came up with the idea of creating a tour guide that had specific knowledge of a different domain of Erie. I also thought it would be interesting to make it geared to Behrend students by giving the distance involved with that site.
- Basic System Functionality
For the basic scenarios my system can handle, the user can ask “Give me food recommendations” to the food expert, ask the history expert “Where can I learn about the War of 1812,” “Give me hiking spots,” “Where can I get a drink,” “What are the spookiest spots in Erie?” These are the prompts I used to ask the appropriate agents, however, the agents are not limited to these questions. The AI uses research that I did via RAG to get recommendations on several food places, historic landmarks, and nature spots worth noting. Other scenarios can be generated from the models like listing more places and getting information based on what the user has previously enjoyed talking about. With these implementations the project can handle any basic questions about Erie’s features as a tourist. 
- Prompt Engineering and Model Parameter Choice
Each agent’s prompt engineering and model choice was based around their adherence to the responses they give the users. The temperature for all three is set to a low 0.1 so that it can be the most factual and adhere to the restrictions while still leaving slight room to be lively in text. The context fields highlight the importance of using the coordinates in the landmark names, being that this is used to calculate the distance from campus in the tool section of the code. The prompts also highlight each agent’s expertise so that the responses correlate to that agent’s purpose. The max tokens were set to 100 to give details about the landmarks/locations to the user, a scenario that is made more immersive due to text-to-speech.
- Tool Usage
This code uses several tools to handle the scenarios outlined in the first section of the report. The main tools used by the AI during the responses is the append_distance_to_coordinates function, including the haversine distance function for calculation, and text_to_speech as a apart of the pyttsx3 library. These tools help not only immerse the user by providing audio feedback, but by also including a distance in miles from Behrend to the given recommendation in the scenario. 
-Planning and Reasoning
This project uses multi-step reasoning by combining retrieved contextual chunks with user queries and computing proximity from Penn State Behrend using coordinates. The reasoning path is explicit from understand query to retrieve from RAG to respond in role to enrich with distance tool to narrate via TTS. This improves conversational coherence and shows chain-of-thought behavior rooted in both retrieved knowledge and calculated insights in the responses given by the three different agents.
- RAG Implementation 
As stated before, RAG is used to inform the agents about Erie local locations in the text file, Erie_guide.txt. By chunking this file, there is a local context that I researched with the help of the Internet to give the AI models a authentic outlook on the recommendations. The RAG is implemented through a Lang Chain text splitter and Chroma pattern from our labs to help achieve this goal for the scenarios. 
- Additional Tools/Innovation
Also mentioned above was the project’s ability to speak to the user about what sites they should visit in Erie. This feature is what I chose to add to the project for innovation purposes. I wanted each scenario to feel immersive as possible so that the user could somewhat replicate what it would be like to ask a local. I set the voice to be different for each agent to add variability and variance to the user’s experience going through the scenarios. I also learned how to add voices via the settings and gave one of the agents a Canadian accent, which in retrospect isn’t unheard of in Erie, PA. This extra tool and library usage added an extra layer of cohesion to the overall project.
- Code Quality and Modular Design
The code is broken down into several functions to help with reusability and have comments and variable names that were chosen for clarity. Once I chose my project, I added it to the repository in its sandbox-like state and refined it through several commits, visible in the GitHub. The code also follows a steady logic throughout the code, first outlining the agents being used, then the tools used in the implementation, and finally the main function loop that pulls everything together.
