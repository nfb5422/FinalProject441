## Historic Destinations

**Erie Maritime Museum and U.S. Brig Niagara
The Erie Maritime Museum is a cornerstone of the city's rich naval history. It features immersive exhibits on the War of 1812 and the legendary Battle of Lake Erie. The centerpiece is the U.S. Brig Niagara, a fully reconstructed tall ship that still sails today for educational voyages and special events. Visitors can board the ship, learn about 19th-century sailing life, and understand Erie's strategic role in American naval defense.

**Presque Isle Lighthouse
Situated on the peninsula of Presque Isle State Park, this lighthouse was built in 1872 and has guided mariners on Lake Erie for over a century. Still operational and open for tours, the lighthouse provides panoramic views from the top and historical insights into Erie's shipping past. A small museum on-site details the evolution of lighthouse technology and the lives of its former keepers.

**Watson-Curtze Mansion
A beautifully preserved Gilded Age estate, this mansion offers visitors a glimpse into the lifestyle of Erie's elite during the early 1900s. With stained glass windows, original furnishings, and lavish rooms, the Watson-Curtze Mansion is also home to the Erie County Historical Society. The basement even features a Victorian-era kitchen and servant quarters that reflect the social dynamics of the time.

**Union Station
Built in 1927, Union Station was once a bustling hub for train travel between New York and Chicago. Its art deco design and expansive concourse still stand, now repurposed for commercial use, including a brewery and event spaces. The building's grandeur makes it a living relic of Erie's industrial prime, and it's often used as a backdrop for community festivals and historical reenactments.

**Erie Land Lighthouse
First lit in 1818, the Erie Land Lighthouse is the oldest on the Great Lakes. It has been rebuilt several times, but still stands today as a powerful symbol of Erie’s maritime roots. Its 49-foot stone tower once held a whale oil lamp visible for miles and now serves as a popular site for history buffs and photographers.

**Historic Little Italy District
A vibrant neighborhood shaped by early Italian immigrants, Little Italy retains much of its old-world charm. Historic homes, murals, family-run businesses, and the enduring Saint Paul Church embody the rich cultural legacy. In the summer, the district hosts Italian festivals with traditional food, live music, and bocce tournaments.

**Erie Cemetery
Established in 1850, Erie Cemetery offers a tranquil, reflective walk through Erie's past. Its winding paths, Gothic mausoleums, and Civil War veteran graves make it both somber and historically rich. The site includes the resting places of several influential figures in Erie’s development, including former mayors, entrepreneurs, and inventors.

**Glenwood Park and Historical Society Grounds
Adjacent to the mansion, this area hosts period homes, barns, and relocated buildings from early Erie life. It often hosts living history events and Civil War reenactments. Children and families can experience 1800s trades like blacksmithing and weaving during seasonal festivals.

**Dickson Tavern
Once an inn for frontier travelers and politicians, the Dickson Tavern is believed to be the oldest surviving building in Erie, constructed around 1815. Though no longer operational as a tavern, the building is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a touchstone for early Erie's hospitality history.

**Hammermill Paper Company Ruins & Memorial
A lesser-known historical landmark, the Hammermill ruins tell the story of Erie’s industrial might.
